# ImageManipulation
A simple learning project for manipulating images

This project is intended to learn how to manipulate images. Most images are sliced into 4 channels pixels. Typically the order of the 
4 channels are Blue, Green, Red, and Alpha. This is currently the only format this project supports. The application loads all the 
images stored in your MyPictures folder, and you can add effects to them using the buttons on the right hand of the UI.

This project is being used to learn a number of skills including image manipulation, data proccessing, git workflows, and WPF.

This project has no other dependencies than .net 4.6.1, and WPF. You should be able to simply download and build, but if not let me know 
and I will do my best to help you.

**Please make all changes on the dev branch. The most recent master commit should generally be stable.**
